ok, this md is my first blog.    
Yesterday, i finished watching *The Social Network*.  
That movie is about Mark Elliot Zuckererg created Facebook.  
The movie conveys a spirit: if u have a crazy idea, go and f**k the world.  

Zuckerberg got this crazy idea from one of his hacking operations 
and the talk with his three classmates.    
In yesterday moring, i took jyy's os class which is talked about Linus.  
Linux also come from a funny idea.
