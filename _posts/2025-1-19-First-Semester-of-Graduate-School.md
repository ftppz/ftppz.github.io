Some interesting things happened this semester.  

I have a new roommate:Xurong-Smart Boy.  

Zhongqiang took me hiking in Suzhou and we met may new friends-Zhong and Liang and so on.

In EE213, i met Z through Jiawei. Cute girl.  
We went to Suzhou and Huangshan.  
But we broke up, i think it's because i don't like her that much which led to the breakup.

Wenlong and i often do HW togother, thx the boy.

Haiwen is married.After the wedding, i went back to Shanghai to take the exam.

I completed my first marathon in Dali Erhai-beautiful city.
