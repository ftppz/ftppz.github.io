Recently, i attended CCF Chip 2024 in Shanghai.  
I met Dr.Deng, her slides are same as before.  
Even although i didn't get the answer that i wanted.  
My Q: your paper demonstrates numerous side-channel attacks,   
but which subset really needs to be considered and defened in the industry?  
Deng A: in fact, there has a standard line in industry and academic.   
if it exceeds the standard line, protection is really need.   
However, some are close to this line, so it depends on the considerations of each manufacturer.

Got her wechart, after reading some papers, i will asd again.  

"世界就是一个巨大的草台班子"    
The leaders who no longer does research, a bunch of useless titles,  
some low-scoring papers.   
These are the academic conference, but there are some good ideas and people.
BOOM adn rocketchip have supported many papers,  
but the results may not be able to work with processors of XS level.  

funny

interesting

LLM needs a slef-reflection machanism.
